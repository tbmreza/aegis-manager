## Features

### Troubleshoot developer's local environment

```sh
aegis checkhealth [-y]
```

Common troubles are grouped based on whether or not it makes sense to automate the fix.
The autofixes must be safe to perform even if status quo is already correct.

#### 1. Troubles reported, fixes suggested.

| Trouble                                                                   | Fix                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `aegis-nginx` container hasn't been restarted since it was first started. | `docker restart aegis-nginx` |
| `vladmir` and `voodoo` are not running on port xx and yy.                 | `npm run dev`                |

#### 2. Troubles reported, fixes suggested, suggestions performed (on user confirmation).

| Trouble                          | Fix                                                                   |

| Alunalun     | redis nginx tarrasque                    | 11      |
